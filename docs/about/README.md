# About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student who loves creating digital experiences that look great and are easy to use. I'm especially interested in designing user-friendly interfaces with a clean and simple style.

I also enjoy learning about design systems, accessibility, and how people interact with technology. I pay close attention to details and like solving problems through smart user-focused design.

Besides design, I have experience working with teams, creating content, and managing social media. I'm always eager to learn new things and want to be part of projects that truly help and inspire users.
